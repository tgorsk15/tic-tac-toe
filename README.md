# tic-tac-toe




Skills that I developed/learned:


- learned how to pass specific parameters from to a function
that is nested within another function, without affecting the 
outer function

- practiced use of factory functions and closures to create private variables and reduce the amount of global scope variables

- pacticed using IIFEs to create an inital instance of a function, whose nested functions can be called upon at a later time

- reduced as much as possible the amount of global variables, demonstrating increased code organization and neatness

- got heavy debugging practice, where I had to pinpoint the error in hundreds of lines of code

- laerned how to integrate display: none and eventListeners to hide several divs (gameBoard, scoreboard, etc..) on initial load
